What are biases? 
Biases are mental shortcuts or assumptions that we make when making decisions or judging situations. They are based on our past experiences, culture, and environment, and can lead to inaccurate judgments and irrational decision-making. Biases can be both positive and negative, but they can also have a detrimental effect on our ability to think objectively and make sound decisions.

Why should we avoid biases?
We should avoid biases because they can lead to discriminatory practices, unfair treatment of individuals or groups, and distorted decision-making. Biases can also cause us to overlook or ignore important information or perspectives that could lead to more balanced and informed decisions.

How to avoid biases?
1. Understand your own biases: Take the time to understand your own biases by reflecting on past experiences, observing your reactions to certain situations, and being open to feedback from others.

2. Be aware of the context: Be conscious of the context in which you are making decisions and be mindful of how it might influence your judgement or opinions.

3. Consider multiple perspectives: Make an effort to consider multiple perspectives and look at a situation from different angles before coming to a conclusion or taking action.

4. Challenge stereotypes: Stereotypes can lead to biased thinking, so actively challenge any stereotypes that come up in conversations or decision-making processes.

5. Seek out diverse perspectives: Seek out diverse perspectives as part of decision-making processes and be open to new ideas and solutions that could lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.

## Confirmation bias
Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that refers to a phenomenon of people seeking out, interpreting, and remembering information in a way that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. People with this bias tend to give more weight to evidence that supports their existing views, while ignoring or undervaluing conflicting evidence.

#### [[Confirmation bias stories]]

#### What are the threats of confirmation bias?
1. Poor decision-making: Confirmation bias can lead to poor decision-making because people are only seeking out information that confirms their existing beliefs, rather than objectively evaluating the available evidence.

2. Faulty problem solving: When faced with a problem, confirmation bias can lead people to ignore potential solutions that don’t fit into their existing belief system. This can lead to faulty problem solving and overall inefficiency.

3. Misguided beliefs: Confirmation bias can cause people to develop and cling to misguided beliefs and ideologies, as they will only seek out information that confirms their existing views. This can lead to ineffective policies, dangerous social movements, and other harmful outcomes.

#### What should we do to avoid confirmation bias?
1. Seek out and consider alternative viewpoints. Make an effort to challenge your own assumptions and beliefs by actively seeking out and evaluating input from people who hold different opinions or perspectives.

2. Acknowledge your bias. Try to be aware of any preconceptions you may have about a particular situation or person, and try not to let those preconceptions influence your judgment.

3. Gather data objectively. Collect information in an unbiased manner, such as by using surveys or experiments to test hypotheses, rather than relying on personal opinion or hearsay.

4. Refrain from making quick decisions. Take the time to evaluate all available data before making a decision, rather than basing it solely on initial impressions or gut instinct.

5. Consult experts when needed. If you’re unsure of how to interpret data, consult experts in the field who can offer an impartial perspective and provide valuable insight into potential solutions or scenarios that may otherwise have been overlooked due to confirmation bias

## Anchoring bias 
Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual relies too heavily on a single piece of information when making decisions, such as an initial estimate or anchor. This bias can lead to decisions that are not based on the actual evidence or information available, and can result in suboptimal decisions. Anchoring bias is most commonly observed in situations where multiple pieces of information need to be considered, such as in negotiations or risk assessment. In a situation like this, one party may take the other's initial offer as the "anchor" and make all subsequent offers based on this number.

Difference between confirmation bias and anchoring bias. 
**Confirmation** bias is the tendency to look for, interpret, or remember information in a **way that confirms** one's preconceptions. **Anchoring** bias is the tendency to **rely too heavily on initial information** when making decisions. This initial information is referred to as an anchor, and it can lead people to make decisions that are not necessarily optimal.

#### [[Anchoring bias stories]]

#### Threats of anchoring bias include: 

1. Overconfident decisions: Anchoring bias can lead to overconfidence in one’s decisions and judgments, leading to poor decision-making. 

2. Excessive focus on irrelevant information: Anchoring bias can cause individuals to become overly focused on the initial anchor, which may not be relevant to the decision at hand. 

3. Biased assessments: Individuals may make judgments that are biased towards the anchor, rather than making a more informed and impartial assessment of the situation. 

4. Limited creativity: Anchoring bias limits creativity by preventing individuals from exploring alternative solutions or ideas that could be beneficial in the long run.

#### What should we do to avoid anchoring bias?

1. Consider alternatives: Make sure to consider multiple options and solutions before making a decision.

2. Collect data: Gather data and facts to support your decisions and don't rely on first impressions.

3. Take time: Don't rush into decisions; take the time to evaluate all the information available before settling on a choice.

4. Be aware: Be aware of potential anchoring bias and actively look for it in yourself and others when making decisions.

5. Ask questions: Ask questions that challenge the anchoring bias, such as “what other options are available?” or “what would be different if we chose another option?”

## Availability bias
Availability bias is an unconscious cognitive bias which occurs when people draw conclusions about the world based on information that is readily available to them. It is a type of cognitive bias in which people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they come across when making decisions. This can lead to biased judgments and irrational decision-making as people tend to focus on the most easily available information and downplay any other facts or evidence. Availability bias can lead to overgeneralizations, inaccurate estimations and distorted interpretations of reality.

Difference between availability bias and confirmation bias?
**Availability bias** is the tendency to rely on information that is readily available or easy to access. This type of bias results in people making decisions based on the information that is most easily accessible to them, rather than looking for more comprehensive data. 
**Confirmation bias**, on the other hand, is the tendency to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms one's existing beliefs and assumptions. People with confirmation bias will actively look for evidence to support their beliefs, while ignoring or dismissing any evidence that contradicts them.

#### [[Availability bias story]]

#### What are the threats of availability bias?
1. Unrepresentative decisions: Availability bias can lead to decisions that are unrepresentative of the greater population, as the data available may not be reflective of the full picture.

2. Limited perspective: Availability bias limits decision makers' perspectives to the information they have available and prevents them from considering a wider range of options or perspectives.

3. Outdated data: Availability bias can lead to decision makers relying on outdated data or information which may no longer be relevant or accurate.

4. Overconfidence: Decision makers affected by availability bias may become overconfident in their decisions as they rely too heavily on the information available without considering alternative possibilities or viewpoints.

#### What should we do to avoid availability bias? 
1. Gather as much information as possible: Make sure you have access to all the relevant facts, figures, and data that are necessary to make an informed decision.

2. Question your assumptions: Ask yourself why you think something is true, and question whether there's any evidence to back up your assumption.

3. Consider alternative perspectives: Try to look at a situation from multiple angles, including those of people who may have different life experiences or opinions than yours.

4. Acknowledge unknowns: Admit when you don't know the answers or when there simply isn't enough evidence yet to draw a conclusion.

5. Consult experts: Seek advice from experts in the field who can provide unbiased and objective insights into the situation.

## Group think bias
Group think bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals in a group agree with one another without challenging each other's ideas. This bias can lead to poor decision-making, as the group neglects to consider alternative points of view or consider potential risks and consequences. Groupthink bias can also lead to conformity, whereby individuals feel the need to conform to the majority view for fear of being judged or ostracized. This can result in decisions that are not optimal or even detrimental to the group's objectives.

#### [[Group think bias stories]]

#### Group think bias can lead to a number of threats, including: 
1. Suppressing Dissent: Group think can lead to a suppression of dissenting opinions, which can cause the group to become isolated and insular, and prevent them from considering alternate solutions or perspectives. 
2. Poor Decision Making: Without dissenting opinions, the group may come to a consensus decision that is not the best solution for the situation. 
3. Lack of Creativity: With everyone agreeing on one course of action, group think can lead to a lack of creativity in problem-solving, as no one is considering or exploring alternative perspectives or solutions. 
4. Loss of Individuality: Group think can lead individuals to abandon their own ideas and beliefs in favor of what the group wants, leading to a loss of individual identity and autonomy.
5. Polarization of Group Opinion: Group think can lead to a polarization of opinion within the group, which can make it difficult for the group to reach consensus on decisions. This can lead to decision-making stagnation and a lack of progress.
6. It can also lead to biased decisions being made as the members of the group may be more likely to agree with the majority opinion, even if it is not the most logical or beneficial one. This can result in a poor outcome for the group and its stakeholders.

#### What should we do to avoid group think bias?
1. Encourage open and honest communication among group members.
2. Make sure all group members feel free to express their opinions without fear of retribution or judgment.
3. Promote diversity in the group by including different perspectives and backgrounds.
4. Encourage critical thinking by asking questions and challenging assumptions.
5. Have a designated facilitator to keep the discussion focused on the task at hand, rather than allowing it to stray into irrelevant topics or personal matters.
6. Consider alternate solutions before making a decision and use objective criteria to evaluate them.
7. Allow for dissenting views without criticizing or attacking those who disagree with the majority opinion.

## Hindsight bias
Hindsight bias is the tendency to believe falsely that one has accurately predicted an outcome after it has already occurred. It is a cognitive bias that occurs when people believe they have foreseen an event, even though there was no evidence of this prior to the event occurring. People tend to overestimate their ability to predict future outcomes, which can lead them to take risks and make decisions that may not be in their best interests or those of others. The hindsight bias can also cause people to think that all events were predictable, even if they weren't actually foreseeable.

#### [[Hindsight bias stories]]

#### What are the threasts of hindsight bias?
1. Overconfidence: Hindsight bias can lead to overconfidence in one's own predictions, causing decision makers to overestimate the accuracy of their previous decisions. This can lead to poor decision making in future scenarios.

2. Misunderstanding of Probabilities: Hindsight bias leads people to falsely believe that certain outcomes were more likely to happen than they really were, leading to a misunderstanding of probabilities and potential outcomes.

3. Ignoring Uncertainty: Hindsight bias can lead people to ignore uncertainty and assume that the end result was the only logical outcome, even if other scenarios were possible at the time of decision-making. This can lead to an overly simplified view of a situation and an inability to consider different possible outcomes.

#### What could we do to avoid hindsight bias?
Hindsight bias can be avoided by taking steps to reduce the chances of being influenced by the outcome of an event. This can include:
-Acknowledge the potential for bias and actively work to counter it.
-Evaluate decisions objectively and focus on the evidence available before making a decision.
-Consider alternative explanations for outcomes, even if they don’t seem likely at first.
-Challenge assumptions and look for ways to test them.
-Reflect on mistakes and use them to inform future decisions.

## Recency bias
Recency bias is a cognitive bias that is caused by a person's tendency to place more emphasis on recent events, rather than those that occurred in the past. It can lead to decisions and judgments being made based on incomplete or inaccurate information, as well as cause people to overestimate the importance of more recent occurrences. This bias can have implications in a variety of areas, including investing, education, and politics.

#### [[Recency bias stories]]

What are the threats of recency bias?
1. Poor decision making: Recency bias can lead to poor decision-making, as decisions are often based on the most recent experiences or trends, which may not reflect the true picture of a situation.

2. Overconfidence: Overconfidence in recent successes can lead to underestimating risk and overestimating the likelihood of future success.

3. Lack of perspective: Recency bias can lead to a lack of perspective and a narrow view of an issue or situation, as an individual may focus on what has happened recently rather than considering a wider range of information.

4. Ignoring past experience: Recency bias can lead to ignoring past experiences and knowledge which could be useful in tackling current situations and challenges.

#### What can we do to avoid recency bias?
Recency bias can be avoided by using a longer time frame when making decisions, such as analyzing data from the past year or more. Additionally, it is important to consider the long-term impact of decisions, rather than simply focusing on short-term gains. Finally, it is important to make sure that all relevant data is taken into consideration when making decisions, and not just the most recent data.

## Outcome bias
Outcome bias is a cognitive bias in which decisions are evaluated based on their outcome rather than the quality of the decision-making process that led to it. This bias can lead to a distorted assessment of the decision-making process, leading to poor decisions in the future. Outcome bias often affects decisions that involve risk, uncertainty, and luck. It can also influence choices in social situations when individuals are rewarded or punished for their choices. 

Outcome bias is especially prevalent in situations when outcomes are binary—such as winning or losing—creating a hindsight or hindsight bias. This type of thinking leads people to think they could have predicted or influenced an outcome after it has already occurred. Additionally, people may overestimate the accuracy of their predictions if they were correct and underestimate them if they were wrong. People may also overestimate their own contributions to success and underestimate those of others, leading to feelings of unwarranted superiority or undeserved criticism.

#### [[Outcome bias stories]]

What are the threats of outcome bias?
1. Unreliable decision making: Outcome bias can lead to unreliable decision making as it relies on hindsight rather than forward-looking judgement. This means decisions may be based on past outcomes rather than the actual merits of an option and may ignore other potential options that may have been more successful.

2. Overconfidence: Outcome bias can also lead to overconfidence in decisions as it can make people feel more confident in their choices as they have already seen success in the past. This could lead to people not considering alternative options or not conducting proper research before committing to a decision.

3. Lack of creativity: When relying solely on outcome bias, people may become less creative or innovative in their decision-making process, leading them to make the same decisions again and again instead of exploring new possibilities or solutions.

4. Missed Opportunities: If decisions are evaluated solely on their outcomes, then it is easy to miss opportunities for improvement or innovation that would have been identified had there been more attention paid to the process itself.

How can we avoid outcome bias?


## Stereotyping
Stereotyping is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to assign characteristics or traits to people based solely on their group membership. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair assumptions about individuals and can cause people to make decisions or form opinions based on these assumptions rather than actual evidence. Stereotyping can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and social exclusion, as well as other forms of inequality and injustice. Additionally, stereotyping can lead people to overlook individual differences and unique attributes, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity in problem solving. 

#### [[Stereotyping stories]]

#### What are the threats of stereotyping? 
1. Discrimination: Stereotyping can lead to discrimination against certain groups of people, as individuals may be judged on the basis of their group membership rather than their individual merits. 
2. Prejudice: Stereotyping can lead to prejudice against certain groups of people, as individuals may develop negative attitudes towards those who do not fit into the predetermined stereotype. 
3. Social Exclusion: Stereotyping can also lead to social exclusion, as individuals may be denied access to certain opportunities because they are not seen as fitting into the “ideal” group member profile. 
4. Inequality: Stereotypes can also lead to inequality between different groups of people, as some may be treated more favorably than others based solely on their group membership. 
5. Lack of Diversity: Stereotypes limit diversity by encouraging the same type of thinking and behavior within a given group or society, thus limiting creativity and innovation in problem-solving and decision-making contexts. 
6. Unfair Judgments: Stereotypes can also lead individuals to make unfair judgments about others based on their group membership rather than actual evidence or facts about an individual’s character or abilities. 


#### What should we do to avoid stereotyping? 
1. Acknowledge your biases: Make an effort to recognize any preconceived notions you may have about a particular group before making any judgments or decisions regarding them. 
2. Question your assumptions: Ask yourself why you think something is true about a particular group and question whether there’s any evidence that supports your assumption before forming an opinion or making a decision regarding them.  
3. Challenge stereotypes: When you encounter stereotypes in conversation or in media, challenge them by asking questions about why these stereotypes exist
