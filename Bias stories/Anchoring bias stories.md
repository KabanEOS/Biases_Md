Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who had recently moved to a new city for his job. He was eager to make some friends and find his place in the community.

One day, John heard about a local bar that hosted karaoke nights every week. He decided to go to the bar and try his hand at singing. When he arrived, he noticed that all of the other patrons seemed to be very confident and experienced performers. 

John was intimidated by this, but decided to give it a try anyways. He picked an easy song that he knew well, but as he began singing he found himself struggling with the notes and felt like everyone was judging him harshly. His performance was far from perfect, but it wasn't terrible either. 

Afterwards, John felt embarrassed and disappointed in himself for not doing better. He believed that everyone in the bar must have thought he was a terrible singer because of how nervous he had been and how poorly he performed compared to everyone else's standards. Little did John know that this was an example of anchoring bias - where his own performance was judged against the more experienced performers around him instead of being judged on its own merits. 

John never returned to the karaoke bar again, instead opting for more solitary activities such as reading or going for walks around town. In reality, John could have become an excellent singer if given some practice and encouragement - something which anchoring bias prevented him from ever discovering.

# 2. Gimme this car
You are looking to purchase a car. You find one you like online, and it's listed at $11,000. After doing some more research, you find that same model car is listed at $9,500 at a different dealership. Even though the second dealership offers the car for a much lower price, you may still be tempted to stick with the original price of $11,000 because it was the first one you saw. This would be an example of anchoring bias.

# 3.  I need em all 
Julia is shopping for a new laptop. She has narrowed her choices down to two models; one more expensive model with more features and one less expensive model with fewer features. Julia looks at the expensive model first, which costs $1,500. After looking at the cheaper model, which costs $900, she realizes that it has all the features she needs. However, because she has already seen the more expensive model first, she is anchored to that price point and decides to purchase the $1,500 laptop instead of the cheaper one.
