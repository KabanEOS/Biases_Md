# 1. Dumb John
John was considering whether to go on a trip to Africa. He heard from a friend that a person who had visited Africa had contracted a rare disease and died shortly after returning home. John remembered this story and used it as a factor in his decision not to go, even though he knew that the chances of him getting a rare disease were very slim. This is an example of availability bias, where people use information more readily available to them, such as stories from friends, rather than looking at more reliable data when making decisions.

# 2. Giving in the neck
Jill had been visiting her grandpa every weekend for the past month. She always looked forward to the time they spent together, and she could tell he enjoyed their visits just as much.

One day, Jill and her grandpa were sitting in his living room discussing life when he made a comment that surprised her.

“You know, there are some women out there who don’t have children because they drink too much alcohol,” he said.

Jill was taken aback by his statement and tried to explain to him that not all women who drink alcohol don’t have kids. She told him that she knew many women who were responsible drinkers yet still had children. But her grandpa was sure of his opinion and didn’t want to hear what Jill had to say.

At that moment Jill realized that her grandpa was using availability bias when he formed his opinion about women and alcohol consumption. He was basing his opinion on his own experience and the experiences of people he knew, rather than looking at the big picture or considering all the evidence available. 

Jill decided not to argue with her grandpa but instead explain why availability bias can lead to inaccurate conclusions in a calm manner. She also reassured him that there were plenty of women out there who drank responsibly and still had children. 

In the end, Jill's gentle explanation worked and her grandpa was able to understand why availability bias can lead us astray and how it affects our decisions in life.
