# 1. Homeless'ish 
Once upon a time, there was a mother who was walking with her child in the city. As they walked, they came across a man who looked like he might be homeless. The mother quickly warned her child to stay away from him and be careful. 

However, as the man approached them, the mother noticed that he was actually wearing expensive clothes and had an iPad tucked under his arm. She then realized that he was actually a hipster programmer who just didn't care what people thought of him despite being well off. 

The mother then laughed at herself for having assumed that the man was homeless due to his appearance and confirmed her own bias. She then told her child: "See how appearances can be deceiving? You should never judge a book by its cover!"

# 2.  Doubting <del>Thomas</del> student
The young woman was sure that her professor was biased against her. She had failed his course three times, no matter how hard she tried. Every time she asked for help, he seemed to be dismissive and unhelpful. She was sure he was out to get her.

One day, she decided to confront him about it in his office hours. When she arrived, she found him speaking to another student who seemed to be receiving much better treatment than she ever had. The professor was friendly and encouraging to the other student while ignoring her presence altogether.

The young woman felt even more sure of her suspicions and began to angrily confront the professor about his bias against her. The professor calmly denied any such bias and tried to explain why she had been failing his course, but the young woman was not convinced and refused to accept his explanations. Ultimately, the professor agreed to review her work more closely and provide feedback on why she was not succeeding in his class. After doing so, he saw that she had made some mistakes that could be easily corrected, and he began to offer her guidance on how to improve her grade in the class. The young woman was relieved and accepted the professor's help, eventually passing the course with a satisfactory grade.


# 3. Confident joke
A professor was giving a lecture, and at the end asked if there were any questions. One student put their hand up and said, "I don't understand why you keep talking about confirmation bias, can you explain it?" The professor replied, "Well, I'm glad you asked that. It's when people only look for evidence that supports their own beliefs." The student nodded and then said, "Ah yes, like when I only listen to your lectures!"
