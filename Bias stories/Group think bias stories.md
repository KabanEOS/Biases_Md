# 1. Wide stream inetrion 
Once upon a time, there was a team working on a project in an office environment. The team was comprised of five members who had different backgrounds and experiences, but were all focused on achieving the same goal.

The team had been working together for several months and had come up with some good ideas. However, one day during a brainstorming session, the team leader proposed an idea that the rest of the group hadn't considered. Most of the team members immediately rejected it without giving it much thought. 

Unbeknownst to them, this was a classic example of group think bias in the office environment. The team leader's idea had potential to improve their project, but because everyone else was so quick to shoot it down, they never fully explored its possibilities. As a result, they missed out on potentially invaluable insight that could have made their project even better. 

The moral of this story is that when working in an office environment, it's important to take some time to consider all ideas and perspectives before making any decisions as a group. Group think bias can be detrimental if not addressed properly!

# 2. Agreable solution
Once upon a time there was a small town near the country's capital. The people of the town had gathered around a square to discuss how to solve their poverty problem. Everyone had their own opinion on what should be done, but no one wanted to stand out or disagree with the group for fear of being laughed at or ostracized.

After a few hours of discussion, the group eventually decided to start a charity organization in the town that would provide food and clothing for those in need. Everyone was happy with this decision and felt like it was the best option. However, no one had actually proposed this idea - it just happened due to group think bias. 

No one wanted to challenge the group's opinion, so they all just went along with it without really thinking about whether it was really the best solution. As time went on, they realized that their charity organization wasn't helping as much as they thought it would, and they eventually had to look at other solutions such as creating more jobs and providing education opportunities in order to truly help those in need. 

The moral of this story is that while it can be tempting to just go along with what everyone else is saying, it's important to take a step back and think objectively about whether or not a decision is really the best solution before committing to it.

# 3. Pray only on the ultimate end.

Once upon a time there was a small village of farmers who were struggling to make ends meet. The village had been suffering from a drought for months and the crops were withering away. In desperation, the villagers held an emergency meeting to decide what to do.

At the meeting, one of the villagers suggested that they should pray to the gods for rain. Everyone in the room immediately agreed with this idea and began to chant prayers together in unison. The villagers continued chanting for hours with no result.

Finally, one of the younger villagers spoke up and suggested that they should try to bring water from a nearby river instead of relying solely on divine intervention. However, no one paid attention to this suggestion and instead continued chanting prayers until nightfall.

The next morning, when it hadn't rained, the villagers all realized their mistake and quickly set out to get water from the river. Thankfully, by doing this they were able to save their crops and avoid disaster.

The moral of this story is that group think bias can be dangerous if it causes people to ignore other viable solutions in favor of something that seems easier or more popular at first glance.
