# 1. Melted pasta, no posible🤌🏻
A group of friends were gathered around the dinner table, discussing their recent vacation. Susan had just returned from a wonderful holiday in Rome and was eager to share her experiences with the others.

"The food was amazing," she said, "the pasta was freshly made and so delicious!"

The others nodded in agreement, but then Harris chimed in. "I went to Rome last month and the food was terrible," he remarked. "The pasta was overcooked and tasteless."

The others looked at Harris with surprise. Although his opinion may have been true, it overshadowed Susan's positive experience due to the recency bias; her story now seemed forgotten as everyone focused on Harris' recent trip instead.
