# 1.  If only I had studied more accurately
Tell a story with an example of hindsight bias
A young woman named Amy had just graduated from college and was about to start her first job. She was really excited about getting her career started, but she was also a bit nervous. She knew that she didn't have a lot of experience, and she was afraid that she might fail in her new role.

One day, Amy was sitting in her office and thinking about all the things she could've done differently in college that would have better prepared her for this job. She wished she had taken more classes related to her field, or interned more often. She started to feel like she should have known better and berated herself for not being more prepared.

This is an example of hindsight bias. Amy was looking back on the past with perfect knowledge of what happened next, which created a false sense of understanding and clarity. If Amy had only known then what she knows now, she would have made different choices - but it's impossible to know the future ahead of time. Hindsight bias can be dangerous because it can lead us to believe that we should have seen something coming when in reality there was no way for us to know what would happen until it actually did happen.

# 2. If only I had chosen smarter
Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who had a big decision to make. He was deciding between two different jobs: one was a higher-paying job with more responsibility but less flexibility; the other paid less but offered much more freedom. After much deliberation, John decided to take the job with higher pay and greater responsibility. 

After some time, John found that he didn't enjoy the job and wished he had taken the other one instead. Looking back on his decision, he became convinced that he should have chosen the other job. This is an example of hindsight bias, where one's views of past events become distorted by knowledge of how those events turned out in the end. 

John found himself wishing he had made a different decision about his job and began to second-guess himself for making what felt like the wrong choice. He began to think that if only he had known how things were going to turn out, then he would have chosen differently. 

In reality, no one could have predicted how things would turn out for John when making his decision. Even if John had known that he wouldn't like his job in hindsight, it doesn't mean that it would have been the right choice for him at the time. Hindsight bias can lead people to believe they should have known something they couldn't possibly know beforehand and can prevent them from learning from their mistakes instead of dwelling on them.
